The package {cdrs} (pronounced "cedars") includes functions to aid researchers in analyzing the California Delta Residents Survey (CDRS) of 2023. Please review the [documentation](https://ktomari.github.io/DeltaResidentsSurvey/doc_cdrs_package.html) which is available on the [DRS GitHub homepage](https://ktomari.github.io/DeltaResidentsSurvey/). A guide to install this package is provided in the following section.

*This document was last updated on `r format(Sys.time(), '%B %d, %Y')`.*

## Installation

You can install the development version of cdrs from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ktomari/cdrs", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

The code above not only installs {cdrs}, but also builds the vignettes. Vignettes are R markdown documents that demonstrate the functions in a package. The vignettes currently available in {cdrs} demonstrate the 'basics' and the 'summary_report'. While the vignettes are in draft form and may contain errors, they are a good place to start to begin using {cdrs}. Try them out after you install the package, using the command: `vignette(topic = 'basics', package = 'cdrs')`
