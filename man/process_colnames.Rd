\description{
This utility function takes both quoted and unquoted column names as input
and returns a character vector of column names. It is designed to facilitate
flexible function arguments, allowing users to specify dataframe column names
either by directly referring to the column names without quotes (unquoted)
or by passing them as strings (quoted).
}
\examples{
# Assuming df is a dataframe with columns named 'Col1', 'Col2', etc.
cdrs:::process_colnames(Col1, "Col2")
# Returns: c("Col1", "Col2")
